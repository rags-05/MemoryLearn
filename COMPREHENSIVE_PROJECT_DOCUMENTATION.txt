2. CORE FUNCTIONALITY EXPLANATION

MEMORY MANAGEMENT SIMULATION:
The system simulates a virtual memory manager that handles page replacement
when physical memory is full. When a memory access occurs:

1. CHECK PAGE TABLE: Determine if page is in physical memory
2. PAGE HIT: If page exists, update access statistics and algorithm state
3. PAGE FAULT: If page doesn't exist:
   - Find victim frame using selected algorithm
   - Load new page into frame
   - Update page table and statistics
4. TRACK METRICS: Record performance data for analysis

CORE METRICS TRACKED:
- Hit Ratio: Percentage of memory accesses that find page in memory
- Miss Ratio: Percentage of accesses that cause page faults
- Page Faults: Total number of pages loaded from disk
- Write Operations: Number of write accesses to memory
- Disk Writes: Number of dirty pages written back to disk
- Execution Time: Time taken to process access pattern

4. ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

4.1 FIFO (First In, First Out) Algorithm
========================================
DESCRIPTION: Replaces the page that has been in memory the longest

HOW IT WORKS:
- Maintains a queue of pages in order of arrival
- When replacement needed, removes page at front of queue
- Simple but may suffer from Belady's anomaly

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Uses frame_queue to track page order
- O(1) insertion and removal operations
- No consideration of page access patterns

STRENGTHS:
- Simple implementation
- Low overhead
- Predictable behavior

WEAKNESSES:
- May replace frequently used pages
- Doesn't consider temporal locality
- Can perform poorly on real workloads

4.2 LRU (Least Recently Used) Algorithm  
=======================================
DESCRIPTION: Replaces the page that hasn't been accessed for the longest time

HOW IT WORKS:
- Tracks access time for each page
- Maintains ordering of pages by recency
- Replaces page with oldest access time

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Uses access_times dictionary to track when pages were accessed
- Updates access time on every page access
- Finds minimum access time for victim selection

STRENGTHS:
- Good approximation of optimal algorithm
- Considers temporal locality
- Generally good performance on real workloads

WEAKNESSES:
- Higher overhead for tracking access times
- May not handle scanning patterns well
- Sensitive to working set changes

4.3 CLOCK/SECOND CHANCE Algorithm
=================================
DESCRIPTION: Enhanced FIFO that gives pages a "second chance" if recently accessed

HOW IT WORKS:
- Maintains circular list with clock hand pointer
- Each page has reference bit set when accessed
- When replacement needed:
  - If reference bit is 0: select page for replacement
  - If reference bit is 1: clear bit and move to next page
- Continues until finding page with reference bit 0

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Uses reference_bits array to track page access
- Uses dirty_bits array to track write operations
- clock_hand points to current position in circular scan
- frame_pages tracks which page is in each frame

ADVANCED FEATURES:
- Reference bit tracking for access patterns
- Dirty bit support for write optimization
- Second chance mechanism reduces unnecessary replacements

STRENGTHS:
- Balance between simplicity and performance
- Better than FIFO for temporal locality
- Lower overhead than full LRU
- Handles burst access patterns well

WEAKNESSES:
- May require multiple scans to find victim
- Performance depends on reference bit accuracy
- Can degrade to FIFO under heavy load

4.4 OPTIMAL Algorithm (Theoretical Baseline)
===========================================
DESCRIPTION: Replaces the page that will be accessed furthest in the future

HOW IT WORKS:
- Requires knowledge of future memory accesses
- For each potential victim page:
  - Find next access time in future references
  - Select page with latest (or no) future access
- Provides theoretical upper bound on performance

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Requires set_future_references() call before use
- Scans future access pattern for each replacement decision
- Returns optimal replacement choice given perfect knowledge

STRENGTHS:
- Theoretical optimal performance
- Provides baseline for algorithm comparison
- Useful for research and analysis

WEAKNESSES:
- Impossible to implement in real systems
- High computational overhead for simulation
- May perform poorly on random access patterns due to implementation

ALGORITHM SELECTION GUIDE:
=========================
- General Purpose: LRU (best overall performance)
- Low Complexity: Clock (good balance of simplicity and performance)  
- Write-Heavy Workloads: Clock with dirty bit tracking
- Research/Analysis: Optimal for theoretical comparison

13. PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

13.1 ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
===================================

OVERALL PERFORMANCE RANKINGS (Based on Comprehensive Testing):

RANK 1: LRU (Least Recently Used)
- Average Hit Ratio: 0.3198 (31.98%)
- Average Page Faults: 3,401
- Consistency: High (low variance across workloads)
- Best For: General-purpose workloads, databases, web servers

STRENGTHS:
- Excellent temporal locality handling
- Consistent performance across workload types
- Good approximation of optimal algorithm
- Strong performance on realistic access patterns

WEAKNESSES:
- Higher implementation complexity
- Memory overhead for access time tracking
- Sensitive to working set size changes

RANK 2: Clock/Second Chance
- Average Hit Ratio: 0.3140 (31.40%)
- Average Page Faults: 3,430
- Consistency: High (stable performance)
- Best For: Real-time systems, embedded systems, OS kernels

STRENGTHS:
- Good balance of simplicity and performance
- Lower overhead than LRU
- Hardware-friendly implementation
- Handles burst patterns well

WEAKNESSES:
